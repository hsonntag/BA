	and inverse solutions},
  journal = {Physics in Medicine and Biology},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {50},
  pages = {2141},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {Fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) is a non-invasive technique where
	measurements of the magnetic field outside the maternal abdomen are
	used to infer the source location and signals of the fetus' neural
	activity. There are a number of aspects related to fMEG modelling
	that must be addressed, such as the conductor volume, fetal position
	and orientation, gestation period, etc. We propose a solution to
	the forward problem of fMEG based on an ellipsoidal head geometry.
	This model has the advantage of highlighting special characteristics
	of the field that are inherent to the anisotropy of the human head,
	such as the spread and orientation of the field in relationship with
	the localization and position of the fetal head. Our forward solution
	is presented in the form of a kernel matrix that facilitates the
	solution of the inverse problem through decoupling of the dipole
	localization parameters from the source signals. Then, we use this
	model and the maximum likelihood technique to solve the inverse problem
	assuming the availability of measurements from multiple trials. The
	applicability and performance of our methods are illustrated through
	numerical examples based on a real 151-channel SQUID fMEG measurement
	system (SARA). SARA is an MEG system especially designed for fetal
	assessment and is currently used for heart and brain studies. Finally,
	since our model requires knowledge of the best-fitting ellipsoid's
	centre location and semiaxes lengths, we propose a method for estimating
	these parameters through a least-squares fit on anatomical information
	obtained from three-dimensional ultrasound images.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Magnetically marked capsules serve for the analysis of
	peristalsis and throughput times within the intestinal tract. Moreover,
	they can be used for the targeted disposal of drugs. The capsules
	get localized in time by field measurements with a superconducting
	quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer array. Here it is
	important to ensure an online localization with high speed and high
	suppression of disturbing fields. In this article we use multipole
	expansions for the simultaneous localization and suppression of disturbing
	fields.METHODS:We expand the measurement data in terms of inner and
	outer multipoles. Thereby we obtain directly a separation of marker
	field and outer disturbing fields. From the inner dipoles and quadrupoles
	we compute the magnetization and position of the capsule. The outer
	multipoles get eliminated.RESULTS:The localization goodness has been
	analyzed depending on the order of the multipoles used and depending
	on the systems noise level. We found upper limits of the noise level
	for the usage of certain multipole moments. Given a signal to noise
	ratio of 40 and utilizing inner dipoles and quadrupoles and outer
	dipoles, the method enables an accuracy of 5 mm with a speed of 10
	localizations per second.CONCLUSION:The multipole localization is
	an effective method and is capable of online-tracking magnetic markers.},

  year = {2006},
  volume = {0},
  number = {0},
  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the electromagnetic model of the fetal brain
	is required for quantitative fetal MEG (fMEG) signal analysis. The
	model is defined by the fetal head position, assuming that volume
	currents are confined to it. Head position can be located by 3D ultrasound.
	Since the ultrasound is presently not integrated with fMEG, there
	is a potential for fetal head motion when the mother moves between
	the two instruments. To interpret the fMEG data without accurate
	information about the fetal head position, a model search must be
	undertaken to localize not only the fMEG source within the fetal
	head, but also the fetal head within the maternal abdomen. Such model
	search results in multiple solutions with different source amplitudes,
	but with roughly the same fit errors [Vrba, 2004]. We show that this
	behaviour is caused by the forward solution ambiguity. For a given
	measurement, there is a large region within the maternal abdomen
	within which all fetal head centers produce reasonably good explanation
	of the observed signal. The source positions within these different
	fetal heads are different, but the resulting signals are indistinguishable
	in the presence of even a small noise. Similar ambiguity also exists
	in adult MEG, where it usually does not pose a problem because the
	head position is well known.},

  abstract = {Fetal brain signals produce weak magnetic fields at the maternal abdominal
	surface. In the presence of much stronger interference these weak
	fetal fields are often nearly indistinguishable from noise. Our initial
	objective was to validate these weak fetal brain fields by demonstrating
	that they agree with the electromagnetic model of the fetal brain.
	The fetal brain model is often not known and we have attempted to
	fit the data to not only the brain source position, orientation and
	magnitude, but also to the brain model position. Simulation tests
	of this extended model search on fetal MEG recordings using dipole
	fit and beamformers revealed a region of ambiguity. The region of
	ambiguity consists of a family of models which are not distinguishable
	in the presence of noise, and which exhibit large and comparable
	SNR when beamformers are used. Unlike the uncertainty of a dipole
	fit with known model plus noise, this extended ambiguity region yields
	nearly identical forward solutions, and is only weakly dependent
	on noise. The ambiguity region is located in a plane defined by the
	source position, orientation, and the true model centre, and will
	have a diameter approximately 0.67 of the modelled fetal head diameter.
	Existence of the ambiguity region allows us to only state that the
	fetal brain fields do not contradict the electromagnetic model; we
	can associate them with a family of models belonging to the ambiguity
	region, but not with any specific model. In addition to providing
	a level of confidence in the fetal brain signals, the ambiguity region
	knowledge in combination with beamformers allows detection of undistorted
	temporal waveforms with improved signal-to-noise ratio, even though
	the source position cannot be uniquely determined.},
